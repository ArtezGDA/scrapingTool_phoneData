Through the day you took and used your phone from place to place. Most people have a mobile network on their phone which is 3g or 4g. To have a good connection there are hundreds of cell towers through the country that makes your phone having a good network. Every cell tower has its own providors that it connects with. If you are subscribed at for instance KPN your phone will only track the towers from KPN. You will never be connected to the same tower all the time because of the distance. If you get further away from one tower you will automaticly connect to another one closer by.
